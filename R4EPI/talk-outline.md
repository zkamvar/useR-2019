I have 18 minutes, which means that I can divide the talk into three four-minute
sections and two three-minute sections.

# 2. Dreams of an Epidemiologist (2 minutes)

"the hope is that the majority of the time you are spending out in the
community, supervising data collectors and getting a feel for the context/risk
factors."

 -- Alex Spina

# 3. Background (3 minutes)
 
What tends to happen is that you have messy data so spend a lot of
time cleaning and then double checking / going back to data managers and
collectors to try and fix inconsistencies. Then probably about once a week you
spend time pulling together figures and numbers from different excel sheets to
write a sitrep together ... which probably ends up taking a whole day depending
on how messy everything is.
.... back logs... more messy data.... no field time.... more messy data.... you
get the picture.

 - Data analysis is integral to informing operational elements of humanitarian
   medical responses. 

 - Field epidemiologists play a central role in informing such responses as
   they aim to rapidly collect, analyse and disseminate results to support
   MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and partners with timely and targeted
   intervention strategies. 

 - However, a lack of standardised analytical methods within MSF challenges
   this process.  Moreover, analytics software to clean, shape, and analyse
   data is often expensive and proprietary. 

 - To address these issues, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts
   to develop standardised methods, scripts, and training using the free,
   open-source data analysis software R, for scenarios that MSF field
   epidemiologists most frequently engage in. 

----------

R4epi in theory simplifies and standardises all of that so that you save a lot
of time pointing and clicking and finding files - and spend more time out doing
what field epi is about.

# 3.1 What did we accomplish (2 minutes)

 - Simplification
 - Standardization
 - Unification

Think the major success is simplifying, standardising and unifying methods for
analysis. Not sure we are entirely there yet but hey presto theory. Think the
major drawbacks to date are the lack of field testing ... hackathon half
addresses that but is still very in-vitro testing!

Alex Spina  [12 minutes ago]
Think the other thing this package gives beyond just msf field work ... is
generally simplifying R for all epis!

# 4. Challenges we faced (2 minutes)

# 5. Feedback from field Epis (4 minutes)

# 6. Further directions (4 minutes)

# What we want to do

 - create ready-to-use templates for use for most common outbreak response scenarios
 - create educational materials to go along with these templates

# Data guides the emergency response

 - collect data (count data)
 - produce basic summary statistics
   - incident curve
   - 2x2 tables (cross-tabulations)
   - Basic summary tables
 - inform decisions for strategic intervention

# Role of epidemiologist

 - Emergency and outbreak response:
   - Population counting;
   - Establishing community based surveillance;
   - Identifying risk factors for infection;
   - Medical data analysis to better target interventions;
 - Surveillance
   - Community based surveillance
   - Indicator based surveillance
   - Event based surveillance
 - Surveys
   - Retrospective mortality; 
   - access to care; 
   - vaccination coverage
   - malnutrition
 - Operational research
 
# Where are the gaps for a field epi?

 - Data collection
   - Messy and incomplete data
 - Data analysis
    - Software license costs and management on high turnover of laptops
    - Different formats of excel spreadsheets
    - Limited automated analysis on current HIS
    - Different data analysis programmes: SPSS, Epi Data, Epi Info, STATA, R, SAS...
    - Lack of consistency ðŸ¡ª One Epi=One Method
    - Methods sometimes wrong, but discovered too late
    - Complex presentation of simple analytical outputs
    - Lack of time to learn how to code
 - Translating data into practice/health programming
    - What does a measles vaccination coverage of 60% mean?
 - Supervision and technical support
    - Time to train/supervise all required aspects is limited

# Switching to R

## Benefits

 - No licensing fees!
 - Newer epis are already coming in with some training in R
 - Automated reports with RMarkdown

## Drawbacks

 - Steep learning curve for newbies
 - Currently no support network among epis
 - No one clear method for analyses

# Implementation

 - Identify priority projects based on frequency in MSF settings, most standard
   possible data
    - Cholera
    - Measles
    - Meningitis
    - Acute Jaundice Syndrome
 - MSF Ethical Review Board pre-approved Surveys
    - Malnutrition
    - Vaccination Coverage
    - Retrospective mortality access to care

# Necessary players

## MSF

 - Field epidemiologists with experience to direct and review template
   construction.

## RECON

 - R programmers with technical knowledge.

# Challenges and pain points

 - Installing R and R packages
 - Analyses that were missing or not-quite-there (aweek, srvyr)
 - Analysts attempting to convert tidyverse code to a package context
 - How do you test templates?
 - Package dependencies. 

# Constant feedback

 - Develop templates and release to field epi to test on real-world data
 - collect feedback
 - improve templates based on feedback

# Virtual hackathons

 - online interaction between field epis and developers
 - what worked?
 - what didn't?

# Future steps

 - video tutorials on R and these templates from Greg Martin
 - release of the templates on CRAN
 - release of templates on drat repository for quick fixes
