## Introduction

Data analysis is integral to informing operational elements of humanitarian
medical responses. Field epidemiologists play a central role in informing such
responses as they aim to rapidly collect, analyse and disseminate results to
support Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and partners with timely and targeted
intervention strategies. However, a lack of standardised analytical methods
within MSF challenges this process. Moreover, analytics software to clean,
shape, and analyse data is often expensive and proprietary. To address these
issues, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts to develop
standardised methods, scripts, and training using the free, open-source data
analysis software R, for scenarios that MSF field epidemiologists most
frequently engage in. 

## Methods

The R4epis project group consists of 18 professionals with expertise in: R
programming, field epidemiology, data science, health information systems,
geographic information systems, and public health. We prioritised the
development of R scripts for outbreak investigation and population based
surveys in emergencies. We organised a collaborative workflow using Github and
Slack, and a lead R coder was designated who distributed tasks between the
team. The development of scripts was done iteratively with input from all
project members. The project was co-managed between MSF and the R Epidemics
Consortium (RECON). 

## Results

Between October 2018 and April 2019, R scripts were developed to address all
aspects of data cleaning, data analysis, and automatic reporting for outbreaks
(measles, meningitis, cholera and acute jaundice) and surveys (retrospective
mortality, malnutrition and vaccination coverage). Analyses and outputs were
piloted and validated by epidemiologists using historical data. The resulting
templates were made available to field epidemiologists for field testing, which
was conducted between February and April 2019. 

## Discussion

R4epis will contribute to the improvement of the quality, timeliness,
consistency of data analyses and standardisation of outputs from field
epidemiologists during emergency response. This will lead to better targeted
and more appropriate medical interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality
amongst those affected by the emergency. Using open-source and free tools
ensures full transparency of analytical methods and high accessibility of used
code beyond MSF operations and will widely benefit the global field
epidemiology community. The multi-disciplinary nature of the R4epis project
fostered interactions between the technical and operational parts of the team.
This approach is being adopted more widely by other operational partners and
national field epidemiology training programmes. Structural collaborations and
funding will be required to implement facets of this project in a sustainable
way.
