What have been the successes of the project? What were the drawbacks?

Alex Spina  [13 minutes ago]
Think the major success is simplifying, standardising and unifying methods for
analysis. Not sure we are entirely there yet but hey presto theory. Think the
major drawbacks to date are the lack of field testing ... hackathon half
addresses that but is still very in-vitro testing!

Alex Spina  [12 minutes ago]
Think the other thing this package gives beyond just msf field work ... is
generally simplifying R for all epis!

Some things I'm specifically wondering about:

What does a day in the life of a field epi look like and how does R4EPI fit
into that?

Alex Spina  [14 minutes ago]
the hope is that the majority of the time you are spending out in the
community, supervising data collectors and getting a feel for the context/risk
factors. What tends to happen is that you have messy data so spend a lot of
time cleaning and then double checking / going back to data managers and
collectors to try and fix inconsistencies. Then probably about once a week you
spend time pulling together figures and numbers from different excel sheets to
write a sitrep together ... which probably ends up taking a whole day depending
on how messy everything is.

.... back logs... more messy data.... no field time.... more messy data.... you
get the picture.
R4epi in theory simplifies and standardises all of that so that you save a lot
of time pointing and clicking and finding files - and spend more time out doing
what field epi is about.

# R4EPIs initiative RECON + MSF

This initiative started out of a proposal to the Sapling Nursery fund from MSF,
which supports MSF staff in developing new ideas that can have a broad impact.
