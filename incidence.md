The epidemiological curve (epicurve) is one of the simplest yet most useful
tools used by field epidemiologists, modellers, and decision makers for
assessing the dynamics of infectious disease epidemics. Here, we present the
free, open-source package incidence for the R programming language, which
allows users to easily compute, handle, and visualise epicurves from
unaggregated linelist data. This package was built in accordance with the
development guidelines of the R Epidemics Consortium (RECON), which aim to
ensure robustness and reliability through extensive automated testing,
documentation, and good coding practices. As such, it fills an important gap in
the toolbox for outbreak analytics using the R software, and provides a solid
building block for further developments in infectious disease modelling.
